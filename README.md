### Description of dataset

The dataset describes the physicochemical properties of red and white variants affecting wine quality. The dataset has a size of 1,599 rows.

### General observations

* Understanding the relationships between chemical analysis and wine quality will provide useful insights for the business to increase wine revenue growth.
* Extensive market research on market segmentation, particularly on consumer preferences, climate and inflation are essential elements in deploying our business strategy.
* In a nutshell, we need to analyze both internal and external factors to yield an optimal business outcome. 
* However, there are limitations in our analysis as the dataset is restricted to only 1,599 records.
* For better understanding, a larger and wider scope of the dataset is needed. 
* Other critical factors affecting wine quality include grape varieties, terroir(natural environment in which grapes are grown) and winemaking techniques should also be taken into consideration.

### Insights

* Check and ensure chlorides and volatile acidity levels are not excessive to ensure desirable wine taste.
* Maintain an optimal amount of alcohol content for higher quality wine.
* Keep density to a minimal amount for higher quality wine.
* Maintain a desirable sulphates amount for wine preservation and taste balance.
