### Description of dataset

The dataset describes the physicochemical properties of red and white variants affecting wine quality. The dataset has a size of 1,599 rows.

### General observations

Understanding the relationships between chemical analysis and wine quality will provide useful insights for the business to increase wine revenue growth.
Extensive market research on market segmentation, particularly on consumer preferences, climate and inflation are essential elements in deploying our business strategy.
In a nutshell, we need to analyze both internal and external factors to yield an optimal business outcome. 
However, there are limitations in our analysis as the dataset is restricted to only 1,599 records.
For better understanding, a larger and wider scope of the dataset is needed. 
Other critical factors affecting wine quality include grape varieties, terroir(natural environment in which grapes are grown) and winemaking techniques should also be taken into consideration.
